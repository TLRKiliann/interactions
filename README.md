# interactions

This application was created to facilitate access to drug interactions.
(This app contains mainly Swiss drugs, but you can also search by molecules.)

All informations are taken from compendium.ch.

Instructions for the user. This program has been developed to understand the 
main interactions between psychotropic drugs. It is not the subject of an 
official reference in psychopharmacology. It is supposed to help, but does 
not provide all possible nuances and subtleties on the use of the drugs being 
treated.

The application includes several search modes, you can find :
- drug families and their interactions
- drugs by molecule and their general interactions
- the interactions between 2 drugs by entering their names.

The main file to launch this app is :
- interact.py

To launch this file, use : \
$ python3 interact.py

Thanks to use it.

Hoping to help with this prog !
