# interactions

This application was created to facilitate access to drug interactions.
(This app contains mainly Swiss drugs, but you can also search by molecules.)

The application includes several search modes, you can find :
- drug families and their interactions
- drugs by molecule and their general interactions
- the interactions between 2 drugs by entering their names.

The main file to launch this app is :
- interact.py

To launch this file, use : \
  python3 interact.py

Thanks to use it.

Hoping to help with this prog !
