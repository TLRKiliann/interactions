# Authors' note

All informations are taken from compendium.ch.

Instructions for the user. This program has been developed to understand the 
main interactions between psychotropic drugs. It is not the subject of an 
official reference in psychopharmacology. It is supposed to help, but does 
not provide all possible nuances and subtleties on the use of the drugs being 
treated.

I decline any responsibility for professional use !

Hoping to help with this prog to understand psychotropic drug interactions.
